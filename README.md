# Design of Sales Database 
In this project, i design a sales database using mysql as a database tool
The table inlcudes
1. Order table - contain all the order placed by a customer
2. product table - contain all the product sold in the store
3. customer table - contain customer information who petronize the store
4. sales transaction table - contain the transaction a customer made
5. category table - contain the category to which a product belong

## Data Normalization
Data normalization were perform to which data redundancy where avoided.
I also make sure that data integrity were observe which improve query performance

The table were queried using sql command and some insight wwere gather from the result
### Here are some critical questions that were asked
* What are the top 5 selling product?
* which city generate the highest revenue?
* what is the sales trend over time?
* what is the consumer behaviour i.e consumer spending habit?
* what payment method is mostly prefer by consumers?
## the folloing actions where take
1. Abuja has the highest spending habit
   * they spend more money per transaction
2. the most selling product is samsung electric microwave
3. customers prefer debit card over other payment method
4. January generate peak sales traffic over other months
## actionable insight
* More Samsung Electric microve should be stock
* Initiate January Sales promotio
* customers from Abuja should be rewarded for their loyalty
* States that has poor sales turnover should have a promotion to increase sales
